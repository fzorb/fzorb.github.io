Welcome to my website, it may look a bit empty for now, but trust me, there'll be more meat soon. This however, isn't my first website under the domain fzorb.xyz. The first website here, was made right after purchasing the domain.
![Initial website, it was actually meant to be fzorb.me](/pictures/fzorbv1.png)


The site was up for a while, but in December 2022, I decided it needed a bit of a glowup, so, I remade my website. Though, I didn't necesarrily find it better. As far as I am aware, it was meant to be a more simplistic version, somewhat like <https://vops.cc/>. It lasted for about 2 months.


Then, last week, for the anniversary of fzorb.xyz, I made the site the fastest I could. Whilst it wasn't mindblowing, it was something. Though, I got numerous complaints regarding it being hard to view on mobile devices, so I decided to just cave in and make a hugo site.
## The current site
I've decided to do a few changes, firstly, this is now hosted on Github Pages, as it's easier to edit stuff. Secondly, this is now a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) website using the [Hello Friend NG](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/)


That's all for today. Fzorb signing out.
